# RScriptsOnline

some scripts in R that I find useful...


* SimpleRemoteScript.R --

```source("http://danielruss.github.io/RScriptsOnline/SimpleRemoteScript.R")```

test that you can run an rscript served by github.
The code simply loads the tidyverse package and leaves a message.  It should crash if you don't have the tidyverse installed. 
1. not a bug.  I don't think forcibly/secretly installing packages on your computer is a nice thing to do.
2. you really should have the tidyverse installed.  Seriously, you should WANT to install it.  DO IT! no peer-pressure DO IT! DO IT!
